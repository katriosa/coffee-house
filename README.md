# Coffee House

Coffee House is a project in which I created a website with two pages, made it adaptive and added interactivity. Fot this I used HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (without using frameworks, libraries).
The website is based on the [Design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SAoBmuOqTfguehdT4IFRxQ/Coffee-House?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=qis81E9Ovgx47eVl-0).

-  adaptive for tablets and mobile devices;
-  smooth animation;
-  appearance burger menu on pages when the width is <= 768px;
-  carousel products on the home page.
-  category switching for products on the menu page.
-  loading more products by button click if there are more than 4 on the menu page.
-  modal for the selected product on the menu page.
